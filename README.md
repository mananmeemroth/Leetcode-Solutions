# 🧠 LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my repository of **LeetCode** solutions, organized by topic.

## ✨ Why I'm Making This

As a student and learner, I'm building this repo for several reasons:

- 🔁 To **notice changes in my coding journey** over time
- 📅 To **track my consistency** in solving problems
- 📚 To **revisit important problems later**, especially before interviews or exams
- 🙌 To **help others** by sharing clean, understandable solutions — possibly with multiple approaches when useful

This repository is organized **topic-wise**, and I aim to update it **daily** (or as regularly as possible). That said, I'm also a student, so during exams or tough weeks, there might be some delays — but I’ll always come back to it.

## 📌 Notes

- All solutions are written by me. I try to explain the logic clearly through code and comments.
- I might add alternate solutions for some problems (brute force vs optimal).
- This is a learning project — feel free to fork, star, or suggest improvements!
